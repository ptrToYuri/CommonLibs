# CommonLibs

## This project is made for educational purposes only.
Prefer using standard library as it is more stable and effective.

**Here I implement some basic containers and algorithms to understand how they work. I hope this repo will also be helpful to other students.**

Documentation is not available right now. However, I'm going to generate it in the future.
